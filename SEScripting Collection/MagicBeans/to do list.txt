+ transceiver script
	-test if new line is a good way of seperating the custom data
	-variables grouped into models vs grouped by comment
	-which are better for grouping named const strings? static class or struct?
	-can i get enums length
	-test that vector3d.TryParse() works well.
	-test that vector3d's match gps pastes when converted to string
+ navigation script
	-write grids name based on role
+ kidneybean script
	-should be alter its course when sensor detects collision. it should keep going without stopping.
	-write grid name based on role
	-possible to add MyDetectedEntityInfo to enemy list? or just fire on neutrals while its being hacked
+ test feasibility of making a new ore detector block similar to beam drill
+ limabean script

KEY METHODS
====================
+ all drones should have turret evasion but should check for room to move is clear using dynamic sensor range.

+ weld unbuilt blocks by casting them to IMySlimBlock. cant get build ratio for armour though

+ 

+ serialize data so that it may survive through session: this.Storage.

+ maybe there is some base class i should invoke in Save()?

+ world oriented alignment for docking: IMyEnity.WorldMatrix
