KEY METHODS
====================
+ add the command your currently working on into this.storage

+ magic beans that are friendly share the same drones. how does that effect each master's allocation? divide resources evenly until an emergency?
	-what is the signal for two magic beans to network?  do they even need to?
	-entity id will change if two items are merged.

+ all drones should have turret evasion but should check for room to move is clear using dynamic sensor range.

+ weld unbuilt blocks by casting them to IMySlimBlock. cant get build ratio for armour though

+ serialize data so that it may survive through session: this.Storage used with Save()

+ world oriented alignment for docking: IMyEnity.WorldMatrix
